# Third attempt at submission
The third attempt at submission to Kaggle used ensembles over previous model and recursive partitioning.

# Loading and Preprccessing

We run the same loading and preproccesing function for both the training and test data sets.
What we try to do is to use the person's title for the modeling.
We can later see in the plots that some people with some titles had more or less chances of survival.
```{r}
mapNamesToTitles = function(y) {
  namesAsChars = lapply(y, as.character)
  firstPartOfNamesBeforeDots = lapply(namesAsChars, function(x) strsplit(x, '.', fixed = TRUE)[[1]][[1]])
  titlesPartOfNamesAsList = lapply(firstPartOfNamesBeforeDots, function(x) strsplit(x, ', ', fixed = TRUE)[[1]][[2]])
  return(factor(unlist(titlesPartOfNamesAsList)))
}

preprocessData = function(data, isTestData) {
  data$Pclass = factor(data$Pclass)
  data$Title = mapNamesToTitles(data$Name)
  if (isTestData) {
    data = subset(data, select=-c(Ticket, Cabin, Name))  
  } else {
    data$Survived = factor(data$Survived)
    data = subset(data, select=-c(Ticket, Cabin, PassengerId, Name))  
  }
}

dataFromFile = function(fileName, isTestData) {
  data = read.csv(fileName, na.string="")
  preprocessedData = preprocessData(data, isTestData)
  return(preprocessedData)
}

trainingData = dataFromFile("train.csv", FALSE)
testData = dataFromFile("test.csv", TRUE)
testDataPassengerIds<- testData$PassengerId
testData = subset(testData, select=-c(PassengerId))
```

Install and load needed libraries
```{r}
if(!require(C50)){
  install.packages('C50')
}
library('C50')
if(!require(tidyr)) {
  install.packages("tidyr")
}
library(tidyr)
if(!require(ggplot2)) {
  install.packages("ggplot2")
}
library(ggplot2)
if(!require(caret)) {
  install.packages("caret")
}
library(caret)
if(!require(e1071)) {
  install.packages("e1071")
}
library(e1071)
if(!require(rpart)) {
  install.packages('rpart')
}
if(!require(rpart)) {
  install.packages('rpart')
}
library(rpart)
if(!require(rattle)) {
  install.packages("rattle", dependencies=TRUE)
}
library(rattle)
if(!require(rpart.plot)) {
  install.packages('rpart.plot')
}
library(rpart.plot)
if(!require(caretEnsemble)) {
  install.packages('caretEnsemble')
}
library(caretEnsemble)
set.seed(123)
```

We want to understand the data better so we plot the different variables after cleaning the data a bit
```{r}
trainingData.Cols<- 1:dim(trainingData)[2]
trainingData.factors <- trainingData.Cols[sapply(trainingData,is.factor)]
trainingData.numerics <- trainingData.Cols[!sapply(trainingData,is.factor)]
trainingData.tidy_factors<-gather(trainingData[,trainingData.factors],"feature","value",-1)
trainingData.tidy_numerics<-gather(cbind(Survived=trainingData[,1],trainingData[,trainingData.numerics]),"feature","value",-1)
```

## Factors plot
First we can look at the factors.
We can see that the Pclass has a lot of clear variance between different classes. This is expected since the upper classes had a lot more chances of getting to the deck in time to escape.
The titles and sex are somewhat related. We can see that males had a lower chance of survival.
```{r}
qplot(x=value,data=trainingData.tidy_factors,fill=Survived) + facet_grid(~feature,scales="free")
```

When we look at non-factor data, we can see that children had higher chances of survival.
There is a clear relation between the fare and the survival rate. This goes together with the pclass.
People with no siblings had less chances of survival than those with at least one sibling. Same goes for passengers with or without parents or children.
```{r}
qplot(x=value,data=trainingData.tidy_numerics,fill=Survived) + facet_grid(~feature,scales="free")
```

## Training and predictions

We train the model with the caret library.
We need to then union the Title factor levels between the test and the training data since the test data has an additional level ("Dona")
```{r}
control <- trainControl(method="cv", number=10)
fit.c50 <- train(Survived~., data=trainingData, method="C5.0", metric="Accuracy", trControl=control,na.action = na.pass)
fit.c50$xlevels[["Title"]] <- union(fit.c50$xlevels[["Title"]], levels(testData$Title))
```

Make the predictions and write them to a file
```{r}
fit.c50.testPredictions = predict(fit.c50,testData,na.action = na.pass)
fit.c50.res <- cbind(PassengerId=testDataPassengerIds,Survived=as.character(fit.c50.testPredictions))
```

### Recursive partitioning

We create results for the recursive partitioning.
```{r}
rpart.trainingDataModel <- rpart(Survived~., data = trainingData)
rpart.predictions <- predict(rpart.trainingDataModel, testData,type = "class")
rpart.res <- cbind(PassengerId=testDataPassengerIds,Survived=as.character(rpart.predictions))
```

This helps us with better understanding the data.
We can see again that certain titles (especially male titles) had lower chances of survival and that the Pclass had a big influence. 
```{r}
fancyRpartPlot(rpart.trainingDataModel)
```

# Results
We got better results from the caret library
